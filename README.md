# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

## Questions:
#### Define Software Engineering:

1. What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
    - Is Is the systimatic application of software engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and produce software systems. It involves the design and development testing deployment and maintenance of software products

   - Traditional programming focuses on the coding aspect of software creation, software engineering encompasses a broader, more structured, and collaborative approach to developing high-quality software that is reliable, maintainable, and scalable

#### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
2. Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
    - The SDLC has 6 phases which are:
        - Requirements - gather and document user needs as well as system requirements
        - Design - create user interface designs and system architecture
        - Implementation - write and build software according to sign specifications
        - Testing - conduct tests to ensure the software meets requiremnts (functional & quality)
        - Deployement - releasing software to clients and customers
        - Maintanance - provinding support and updates after the software has been deployed

#### Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
3. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
    - Agile is great for big projects as it is increamental. It is collaborative and responds to change. The Waterfall is good for short term projects. You can't proceed without completing the previous requirement or step(sequential). 

#### Requirements Engineering:
4. What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

#### Software Design Principles:

5. Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
    - add answer here

#### Testing in Software Engineering:

6. Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
    - add answer here

### Version Control Systems:

7. What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
    - add answer here

#### Software Project Management:

8. Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
    - add answer here

#### Software Maintenance:

9. Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
    - add answer here

#### Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

10. What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
    - add answer here
